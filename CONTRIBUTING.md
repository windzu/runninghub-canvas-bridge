# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in RunningHub Canvas Bridge.

This project is currently in a research/prototype stage. For now, please open Issues for bugs, feature ideas, API observations, and design feedback. Pull Requests are not being reviewed or accepted yet.

## Good Issues

A useful Issue should include:

- A clear title that names the behavior or proposal.
- Your environment: operating system, Node.js version, browser, and whether the bridge server and extension were both running.
- The exact command or workflow you tried.
- Expected behavior and actual behavior.
- Relevant error messages, with cookies, tokens, authorization headers, private canvas content, and private media URLs removed.
- Reproduction steps using placeholders such as `<canvas_id>`, `<node_id>`, and `<client_id>`.

## Bug Reports

For bugs, please include:

- Output from `npm run bridge -- health`.
- Output from `npm run bridge -- preflight`.
- Whether refreshing the RunningHub canvas page changes the result.
- Whether the issue affects one canvas or every canvas you tested.

Do not paste raw request headers, localStorage values, cookies, access tokens, or private RunningHub payloads. If a payload shape matters, replace private values with placeholders.

## Feature Requests

For feature requests, please describe:

- The Agent workflow you want to enable.
- The RunningHub node types or endpoints involved, if known.
- Whether the feature should be read-only, canvas-mutating, or generation-running.
- Any safety constraints, especially if the workflow can spend credits.

## API Observations

RunningHub internal APIs can change without notice. If you share observations from browser traces or bridge events, redact private fields before posting.

Good redaction examples:

- `canvasId: "<canvas_id>"`
- `nodeId: "<node_id>"`
- `Authorization: "[REDACTED]"`
- `token: "[REDACTED]"`

## Current Maintainer Policy

- Issues are welcome.
- Pull Requests are not accepted at this stage.
- Security-sensitive findings should be reported without public secrets or exploitable private payloads.
